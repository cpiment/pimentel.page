This is my personal blog. It's made with gatsby and you can run it and modify it as you please (see LICENSE)

## Development

I have developed it using Node 14 and NPM 6. Once you have them installed you can start the Gatsby development
server using

```shell
npm install
npx gatsby develop
```

`npm install` is only needed the first time.

Now the complete site will be running in http://localhost:8000

## Test

WIP

## Build

Run

```shell
npx gatsby build
```

The complete site will be created inside the `public` directory and can be copied into
the document root of your web server
