I have configured 'prism-react-renderer' to be used alongside 'gatsby-plugin-mdx'
to have some syntax highlighting for code snippets. Let's try it out! 

JavaScript
```js
import React from 'react'
import Example from './place'

export default () => <Example />
```
C
```c
printf("Hello World!\n")
``` 
Java
```java
System.out.println("Hello World!")
```

Powershell
```powershell
Get-Content .\file.txt | ForEach-Object {
    if($_ -match $regex){
        # Work here
    }
}
```
