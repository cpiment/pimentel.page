As noted in [my last post](/blog/gatsby-updated), after upgrading the site from Gatsby 4 to Gatsby 5
the [blog](/blog) link broke, post where not showing up, and some weird errors were showing
in the browser console.

It has not been until now that I have had time to review this, and to my surprise, the site worked fine
without doing anything. Maybe it was something related to my browser cache at that time.

Nevertheless, some [React 425 errors](https://www.paulie.dev/posts/2022/10/react-hydration-error-425-text-content-does-not-match-server-rendered-html/)
were still showing up in the console. After some investigation, it seemed that rendering the page title
inside the `title` element of the blog layout was not behaving the same way for the [home](/) page
and the rest of the pages of the blog. [This](https://github.com/cpiment/pimentel.page/commit/20dd3661db10e6a720aa865da58724820749c0b8) is the fix.

Since I had allocated time to fix that issue, I have also fixed some other cosmetic problems and updated the dependencies. 
Let's see if I start updating this with higher frequency!
