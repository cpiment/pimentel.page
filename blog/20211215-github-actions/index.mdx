> The GitHub Workflow has been modified to use rsync instead of SCP. I have modified the yaml in this post to reflect those changes

As you probably already know, the source code of this blog is 
posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/cpiment/pimentel.page).

In order to improve my development workflow I searched for a way
to deploy new blog contents into the hosting provider using GitHub actions,
and I found this [blog post](https://www.andrewvillazon.com/automatically-deploying-with-github-actions/)
with some workflow code I could tune for my use case:

```yaml
## Based on https://www.andrewvillazon.com/automatically-deploying-with-github-actions/
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    name: Build and deploy Gatsby site
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Set variables
        run: |
          VER=$(cat .node-version)
          echo "NODE_VERSION=$VER" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      
      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
      
      - name: Install Project Dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Build
        run: npx gatsby build
      
      - name: Verify build
        run: ls -la public

      - name: Modify .htaccess
        run: sed -i -e 's/Options -MultiViews//' public/.htaccess
      
      - name: Setup SSH
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh/
          echo "${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/deploy_key
          sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/deploy_key
          ssh-keyscan -p 10922 -H "${{ secrets.HOST }}" > ~/.ssh/known_hosts
      
      - name: Rsync upload
        run: rsync -av -e "ssh -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key -l ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USER }} -p 10922" public/ ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USER }}@${{ secrets.HOST }}:html/
```

This workflow builds the project using the node version of the file `.node-version` 
of the repository and `gatbsy build` and then uses `rsync` to upload the `public`
directory contents to the hosting provider document root. Pretty neat!
