This is my first blog post!

I will be using this blog as an online notebook of problems, 
solutions, integrations and hacks that I have to do as part
of my daily job or my personal hobbies.

Sure this will be useful for me, but I'm posting it online
to share the knowledge I compile from different sources
and my solutions to the problems I found.

I think this also will be a great opportunity to improve my
rusty English skills.
