Vacation is a good time to recover past hobbies. I'm investing some time
in upgrading the blog (more than one year since last post...), and the first
step should be upgrading GatsbyJS.

This has implied:

* Upgrading Gatsby from v4 to v5
* Upgrading Node from v14 to v18
* Upgrading React from v17 to v18

My first intention was to stay a little more time in the last Gatsby v4, 
but when I upgraded the `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to latest version, I found that
the GFM extensions for Markdown stopped working. It seemed that the only way
to work around that was to upgrade to Gatsby v5, so here we are!

I recommend this resources for the upgrade:

* [Official docs for the upgrade](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v4-to-v5/)
* [`gatsby-plugin-mdx` docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/)
* [ES Modules and Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/custom-configuration/es-modules/)
* [This Reddit post 'Gatsby 5 + MDX2: support for tables?'](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatsbyjs/comments/107nnj2/gatsby_5_mdx2_support_for_tables/)
* [This commit of my blog with the changes](https://github.com/cpiment/pimentel.page/commit/9e3922eb2de3dc2b1e9a9a40852f927ac3ee6a67)
