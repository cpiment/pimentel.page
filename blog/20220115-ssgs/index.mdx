When I decided that I wanted to create a blog, I knew that I wanted to
use a <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr>. That would allow me to
have my full site without the need of mantaining and taking care of a database
for the blog posts. So I did a quick search of SSGs and after reading documentation
of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), 
I decided that I would give Gatsby a go.

This is a quick comparison of features

|                   | Gatsby             | Pelican                    |
|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| Language          | Javascript (React) | Python                     |
| Markup            | Markdown, MDX      | Markdown, reStructuredText |
| Plugin Repository | Yes                | Yes                        |
| Online resources  | Millions           | Hundreds of thousands      |

I read the "Getting Started" documentation of both projects, and decided that 
even I'm not proficient in Python nor Javascript, I wanted to improve my JS/React skills.

In this case I think that there are no wrong choices, since this is a personal project. 
It seems that Gatsby is much more customisable, but is also heavier. For example, as of today, 
with only 11 pages, it takes 2-3 minutes to build the site from scratch.
