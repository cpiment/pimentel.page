When I decided that I wanted to create a blog, I knew that I wanted to
use a <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr>. That would allow me to
have my full site without the need of mantaining and taking care of a database
for the blog posts. So I did a quick search of SSGs and after reading documentation
of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), 
I decided that I would give Gatsby a go.
